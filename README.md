# Coffee Machine Simulator

## About
This is a simple **coffee machine simulation** built in Python to demonstrate my understanding of:
- Dictionaries for storing menu items and resources
- Loops and conditional statements for user interaction
- Function usage (`refill()`)
- Error handling for user input
- Basic transaction handling (coin inputs and change calculation)

The program allows users to order coffee, check available resources, refill ingredients, and turn off the machine.

## Features
✔ **Three Coffee Options**: Cappuccino, Latte, and Espresso  
✔ **Resource Management**: Ensures enough ingredients before making a drink  
✔ **Coin-Based Payment System**: Accepts pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters  
✔ **Admin Commands**:  
   - `report` → Shows remaining ingredients and total earnings  
   - `refill` → Resets resources to full  
   - `off` → Shuts down the machine  

## How to Run
Simply run the script in a Python environment:
```bash
python coffee_machine.py
```
Then follow the prompts to order a coffee or perform admin actions.
